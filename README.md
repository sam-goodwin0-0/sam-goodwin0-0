# Hi! I'm Sam 
*(she/her)*

### A Little bit about Me
Hi! My name is Sam  :) I'm currently studying to get my ***Bachelors in Computer Science*** (!!) at the University of Witwaterstrand in South Africa. Coding is just one thing among many that I love. I'm also an avid climber, reader, creative and all-round nerd! >w< 


### My Experience
Coding has been a passion of mine since I was very young, but I didn't properly get into it until Grade 10 when I started taking Cambridge (CIE) Computer Science at school. 
I'm currently dabbling in many different **programming languages**:
- Python
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Matlab
